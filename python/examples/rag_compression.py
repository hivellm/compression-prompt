        Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on 
        building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. Deep 
        Learning, a specialized branch of Machine Learning, uses neural networks with 
        multiple layers to process complex patterns in large datasets. These models 
        are trained on massive amounts of data to recognize patterns and make predictions.

        """
        Natural Language Processing (NLP) enables computers to understand, interpret, 
        and generate human language. Modern NLP systems use transformer architectures 
        like BERT and GPT to achieve state-of-the-art performance on tasks such as 
        translation, summarization, and question answering. These models process text 
        through attention mechanisms that capture contextual relationships.

        recognition, object detection, facial recognition, and autonomous vehicle 
        navigation systems. Convolutional neural networks process visual data through 
        multiple layers to extract features and patterns.
