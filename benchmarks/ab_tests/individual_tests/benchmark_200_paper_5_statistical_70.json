The rst approximation, 1 , reects the Gaussian ap- proximation to the posterior. The integral in the left hand side of Eqn. (4) is intractable. By performing a Taylor expansion on ln h(( f x )) (see supplementary material) we can see that it can be approximated up to O ( f 4 x ) by a squared exponential curve, exp ( f 2 x = ln 2). We will refer to this approximation as 2 . Now we can apply the standard convolution formula for Gaussians to nally get a closed form expression for both terms of Eqn. (2). Fig. 1 depicts the striking accuracy of this simple approximation. The max- imum possible error that will be incurred when using this approximation is if N ( f x j x ; D ; 2 x ; D ) is centred at x ; D = 2 : 05 with 2 x ; D tending to zero (see Fig. 1, absolute error ), yielding only a 0.27% error in the integral in Eqn.

In Section 5 we investigate experimentally the information lost from approximations 1 and 2 as compared to the golden standard of extensive Monte Carlo simulation.
