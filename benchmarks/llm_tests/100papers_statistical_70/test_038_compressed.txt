@ x k grows exponentially fast with l , and it does so along direction q . The assumes diagonalizable simplic- ity, though using Jordan normal form one can extend this considering just eigen- vector eigenvalue but whole subspace spanned eigenvectors sharing same (largest) eigenvalue. This result provides a necessary condition gradients to grow, namely that spectral radius (the absolute value eigenvalue) W must be larger than 1. If not in null space @ + x k
