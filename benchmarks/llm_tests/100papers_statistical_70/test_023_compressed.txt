Figure 3. Bifurcation diagram single hidden unit RNN (with xed recurrent weight 5.0 and adjustable bias b ; example introduced Doya (1993)). See text. We show there two types events could lead change x , with ! 1 . One cross- ing boundary between basins attraction (depicted with unlled circles), while other crossing bi- furcation boundary (lled circles). For , x resulting from change b will be even for very small changes (as system attracted towards dierent attractors) which leads gradient. It however neither necessary nor sucient cross for gradients explode, as bifurca- tions global events could have no eect lo- cally. Learning traces out path parameter- state space. If we at boundary, but state model such it basin attraction one attractor (from many possible attrac- tors) does not change shape or disappear when bifurcation crossed, then this bifurcation will not aect learning.
