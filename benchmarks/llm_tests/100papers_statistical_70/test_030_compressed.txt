This algorithm very similar one proposed by Tomas Mikolov we only diverged from original proposal attempt provide better theoretical foundation (ensuring that always move de- scent direction with respect current mini-batch), though practice both variants behave similarly. proposed clipping simple implement computationally ecient, but it does however in- troduce additional hyper-parameter, namely threshold.
