Crossing boundaries between basins attraction local event, and it sucient gradients ex- plode. If we assume that crossing into an emerging attractor or from disappearing one (due bifur- cation) qualies as crossing some boundary between attractors, can formulate sucient condition gradients explode which encapsulates obser- vations made Doya (1993), extending them also normal boundaries dierent basins attractions. Note how gure, there are only two values b bifurcation, but whole range values which there be boundary crossing. Another limitation previous analysis they only consider autonomous systems assume observations hold input-driven models. In (Ben- gio et al. , 1994) dealt assuming bounded noise. The downside this approach limits how one reason about input. In practice, supposed drive dynamical system, being able leave model attrac- tor state, or kick out basin attraction when certain triggering patterns present themselves. We propose extend our analysis driven models folding into map. We consider family maps F t , where apply dierent F t at each step. Intuitively, gradients explode require same behaviour as before, where (at least some direction) maps F 1 ; ::; F t agree and change direction. Fig. 4 describes this behaviour.
