@ x k grows exponentially fast with l , and it does so along the direction q j .  The proof assumes W rec is diagonalizable for simplic- ity, though using the Jordan normal form of W rec one can extend this proof by considering not just the eigen- vector of largest eigenvalue but the whole subspace spanned by the eigenvectors sharing the same (largest) eigenvalue. This result provides a necessary condition for gradients to grow, namely that the spectral radius (the absolute value of the largest eigenvalue) of W rec must be larger than 1. If q j is not in the null space of @ + x k
