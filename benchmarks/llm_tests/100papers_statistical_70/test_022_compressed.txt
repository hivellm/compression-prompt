Drawing similarities with Dynamical Systems We can improve our understanding exploding gradients vanishing gradients problems by employ- ing dynamical systems perspective, it was done before Doya (1993); Bengio et al. (1993). We recommend reading Strogatz (1994) formal detailed treatment dynamical systems theory. For any parameter assignment , depending on ini- tial 0 t an autonomous dynamical system converges, under repeated application map F one several possible dierent attrac- tor states (e.g. point attractors, though other type attractors exist). model could also nd itself chaotic regime, case which some following observations may not hold, but not treated depth here. Attractors describe asymptotic be- haviour model. space divided into basins attraction, one each attractor. If model started one basin attraction, model will converge corresponding attractor t grows. Dynamical systems theory tells us changes slowly, asymptotic behaviour changes smoothly almost everywhere except certain crucial points where drastic changes occur (the new asymptotic be- haviour ceases be topologically equivalent old one). These points called bifurcation boundaries caused by attractors appear, disappear or change shape. (Doya, 1993) hypothesizes such bifurcation cross- ings could cause gradients explode. We would like extend this observation into sucient condi- tion gradients explode, reason will re-use one-hidden unit model (and plot) from (Doya, 1993) (see Fig. 3). x-axis covers parameter y-axis asymptotic . bold line follows move- ment nal point attractor, changes.

In interval ( ; 2 ) are rich regime, where there are two attractors change position boundary between them, as change , is traced out by dashed line.
