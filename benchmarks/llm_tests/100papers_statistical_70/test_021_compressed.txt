@ x (see equation (5)) that take form product t Jacobian matrices. In same way product t real numbers can shrink zero or explode innity, so does this product matrices (along some direction v ). In what follows we will try formalize these intu- itions (extending similar derivation done in Bengio et al. (1994) where only single hidden unit case was considered). If consider linear version model (i.e. set identity function in equation (11)) use power iteration method formally analyze this prod- uct Jacobian matrices obtain tight conditions when gradients explode or vanish (see sup- plementary materials detailed derivation conditions). It sucient largest eigenvalue recurrent weight matrix be smaller than long term components vanish (as ! necessary it be larger than gradients explode. We generalize results nonlinear functions where absolute values 0 ( x ) bounded (say by value 2 R ) therefore diag ( 0 ( x )) . We rst prove that it is sucient <
