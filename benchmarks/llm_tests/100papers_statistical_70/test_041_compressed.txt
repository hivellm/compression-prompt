10 ]. The task is predict order in which non-distractor symbols were provided, i.e. either f AA; AB; BA; BB g . We use 50 hidden units model, learning rate .001 and , regularization coecient, set 2. cut-o threshold clipping norm gradient left 6. As other two task we 100% success at training deal sequences between 200 steps. This outperforms previous state art because success rate, but also generalizes longer sequences (up 400 steps). 3-bit temporal order problem Similar previous one, except that we have 3 random positions, rst sampled from [ T
