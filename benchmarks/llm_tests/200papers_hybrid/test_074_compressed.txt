other words, play following two-player minimax game with value function V G; : min max V D; = E p data [log )] + E p [log(1 )))] : (1) next section, present theoretical analysis adversarial nets, essentially showing criterion allows recover generating distribution given enough capacity, i.e., non-parametric limit. See Figure less formal, more pedagogical explanation approach. must implement using an iterative, numerical approach. Optimizing completion computationally prohibitive, on nite datasets would result overtting. Instead, alternate between k steps optimizing being maintained near its optimal solution, so long changes slowly enough. strategy analogous way SML/PCD [31, 29] maintains Markov learning order avoid burning Markov part The procedure formally presented Algorithm 1. equation may not provide sufcient gradient learn well. Early learning, when poor, reject high condence because they clearly different data. this case, log(1 ))) saturates. Rather than minimize log(1 ))) can train maximize log )) . This objective function results same xed point dynamics but provides much stronger gradients early learning.
