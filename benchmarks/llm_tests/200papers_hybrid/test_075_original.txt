(a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 1: Generative adversarial nets are trained by simultaneously updating the d iscriminative distribution ( D , blue, dashed line) so that it discriminates between samples from the data generating distribution (black, dotted line) p x from those of the g enerative distribution p g (G) (green, solid line). The lower horizontal line is the domain from which z is sampled, in this case uniformly. The horizontal line above is part of the domain of x . The upward arrows show how the mapping x = G ( z ) imposes the non-uniform distribution p g on transformed samples. G contracts in regions of high density and expands in regions of low density of p g . (a) Consider an adversarial pair near convergence: p g is similar to p data and D is a partially accurate classier. (b) In the inner loop of the algorithm D is trained to discriminate samples from data, converging to D  ( x ) = p data ( x )
