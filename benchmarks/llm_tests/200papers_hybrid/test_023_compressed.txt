Figure 3. Bifurcation diagram single hidden unit RNN (with xed recurrent weight 5.0 and adjustable bias ; example introduced Doya (1993)). See text. We show there two types lead . One cross- ing between basins (depicted unlled circles), while crossing bi- furcation (lled circles). resulting even very small changes (as system attracted towards dierent attractors) which leads gradient. It however neither necessary nor sucient cross gradients explode, bifurca- tions global have no eect lo- cally. Learning traces out parameter- If boundary, model such it basin one attractor (from many possible attrac- tors) does shape or disappear when crossed, then this aect learning.
