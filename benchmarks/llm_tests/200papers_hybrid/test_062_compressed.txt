## 5.1 Training Stability supervised learning, one easily track performance model evaluating it validation sets. reinforcement learning, however, accurately evaluating progress challenging. Since evaluation metric, as suggested [3], collects episode or game averaged over number games, we periodically compute it training. metric tends very noisy because small changes weights lead large changes distribution visits . leftmost evolves Seaquest Breakout. Both averaged are indeed quite noisy, giving impression learning algorithm making steady progress. Another, stable, policyâ€™s estimated action-value function , which provides estimate discounted obtain following its from given state. We collect xed set running random before starts maximum for these states. rightmost increases smoothly than obtained plotting same metrics other ve games produces similarly smooth curves. addition seeing relatively smooth improvement Q we did not experience divergence issues experiments. This suggests that, despite lacking theoretical convergence guarantees, our method able train large neural networks using reinforcement learning signal stochastic gradient descent stable manner.
