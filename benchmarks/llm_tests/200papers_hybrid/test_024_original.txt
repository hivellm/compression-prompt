Crossing boundaries between basins of attraction is a local event, and it is sucient for the gradients to ex- plode. If we assume that crossing into an emerging attractor or from a disappearing one (due to a bifur- cation) qualies as crossing some boundary between attractors, that we can formulate a sucient condition for gradients to explode which encapsulates the obser- vations made in Doya (1993), extending them to also normal crossing of boundaries between dierent basins of attractions. Note how in the gure, there are only two values of b with a bifurcation, but a whole range of values for which there can be a boundary crossing. Another limitation of previous analysis is that they only consider autonomous systems and assume the observations hold for input-driven models. In (Ben- gio et al. , 1994) input is dealt with by assuming it is bounded noise. The downside of this approach is that it limits how one can reason about the input. In practice, the input is supposed to drive the dynamical system, being able to leave the model in some attrac- tor state, or kick it out of the basin of attraction when certain triggering patterns present themselves. We propose to extend our analysis to input driven models by folding the input into the map. We consider the family of maps F t , where we apply a dierent F t at each step. Intuitively, for the gradients to explode we require the same behaviour as before, where (at least in some direction) the maps F 1 ; ::; F t agree and change direction. Fig. 4 describes this behaviour.
