Duchi et al. (2011), or Moreira and Fiesler (1995) for an overview), we rely on the instantaneous gradient. This means that we can handle very abrupt changes in norm, while the other methods would not be able to do so. 3.3. Vanishing gradient regularization We opt to address the vanishing gradients problem us- ing a regularization term that represents a preference for parameter values such that back-propagated gra- dients neither increase or decrease too much in mag- nitude. Our intuition is that increasing the norm of @ x t
