P exp S . The reason that maximisation posterior can be achieved by minimising scores other classes. Therefore, we optimise S to ensure that optimisation concentrates only on question . We also experimented optimising posterior P but results were not visually prominent, thus conrming our intuition. 3 Image-Specic Class Saliency Visualisation In this section describe how classication ConvNet queried about spatial support particular given image. Given an classication ConvNet function would like rank pixels based their inuence We start motivational example. Consider linear model for : = T + b ; (2) where represented vectorised (one-dimensional) form, b are respec- tively weight vector bias model. In this case, it easy see that magnitude elements denes importance corresponding pixels for In case deep ConvNets, highly non-linear function so reasoning previous paragraph not immediately applied. However, given an image we can approximate linear function neighbourhood by computing rst-order Taylor expansion: T + b; (3) where w derivative S respect to image at point (image) 0 : w = @S
