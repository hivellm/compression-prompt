The main difference that, (Graves, 2013), modes annotations move one direction. machine translation, limi- tation, (long-distance) reordering often needed grammatically correct (for instance, English-to-German). Our approach, hand, requires computing annotation weight every sentence for translation. This drawback not which most input output are only 1540 words. However, this may limit applicability proposed scheme other tasks. 8
