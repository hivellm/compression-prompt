@ will dom- inate the sum and because this term grows exponen- tially fast to innity with t , the same will happen to the sum. Experimental setup Note that all hyper-parameters where selected based on their performance on a validation set using a grid search. The pathological synthetic tasks Similar success criteria is used in all of the tasks be- low (borrowed from Martens and Sutskever (2011)), namely that the model should make no more than 1% error on a batch of 10000 test samples. In all cases, discrete symbols are depicted by a one-hot encoding, and in case of regression a prediction for a given se- quence is considered as a success if the error is less than 0.04. Addition problem The input consists of a sequence of random numbers, where two random positions (one in the beginning and one in the middle of the sequence) are marked. The model needs to predict the sum of the two ran- dom numbers after the entire sequence was seen. For each generated sequence we sample the length T 0 from [ T; 11
