4.2 Convergence Algorithm 1 Proposition 2. If G and have enough capacity, at each step Algorithm 1, discriminator allowed reach its optimum given G , updated so improve criterion E data [log G )] + E [log(1 G ))] then converges data Proof. Consider V G; = U ; function done above criterion. Note that U ; . The subderivatives supremum functions include derivative function point where maximum attained. In other words, if = 2A for every then @f 2 @f if = arg sup 2A . This equivalent computing gradient descent update for optimal given cor- responding G . sup U ; convex with unique global optima as proven Thm 1, therefore with sufciently small updates , converges , concluding proof.
