2 4 Theoretical Results generator G implicitly denes probability distribution as samples G ( ) obtained when Therefore, would like converge good estimator , if given enough training time. results done non- parametric setting, e.g. represent model innite studying convergence space density functions. 4.1 minimax game has global optimum = We then 4.2 Algorithm optimizes Eq 1, thus obtaining desired result. 3
