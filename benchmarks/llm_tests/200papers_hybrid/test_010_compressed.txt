Although BALD generalise selecting continuous this enables us compare algorithms that cannot. We compare eight other algorithms: random sampling, MES, QBC (with committee members), SVM version space approximation Tong Koller, 2001 ], decision theoretic approaches Kapoor 2007 , Zhu 2003 ] directly minimizing 10
