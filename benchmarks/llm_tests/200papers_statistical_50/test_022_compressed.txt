Drawing similarities with Dynamical Systems We can improve our understanding exploding vanishing problems employ- ing perspective, it was done before Doya (1993); Bengio et al. (1993). We recommend reading Strogatz (1994) formal detailed treatment theory. For any parameter assignment depending on ini- tial 0 an autonomous system converges, under repeated application map F several possible dierent attrac- states (e.g. attractors, though other type exist). also nd itself chaotic regime, case which some following observations may hold, but treated depth here. Attractors describe model. space divided basins attraction, each attractor. If started basin attraction, converge corresponding attractor grows. Dynamical theory tells us slowly, behaviour smoothly almost everywhere except certain crucial drastic occur (the haviour ceases be topologically equivalent old one). These called boundaries caused appear, disappear or shape. hypothesizes such cross- ings cause explode. like extend this observation sucient condi- tion explode, reason re-use one-hidden unit (and plot) (see Fig. 3). x-axis covers y-axis bold line follows move- ment nal attractor, changes.
