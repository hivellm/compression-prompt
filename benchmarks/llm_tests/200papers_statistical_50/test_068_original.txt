P c exp S c . The reason is that the maximisation of the class posterior can be achieved by minimising the scores of other classes. Therefore, we optimise S c to ensure that the optimisation concentrates only on the class in question c . We also experimented with optimising the posterior P c , but the results were not visually prominent, thus conrming our intuition. 3  Image-Specic Class Saliency Visualisation In this section we describe how a classication ConvNet can be queried about the spatial support of a particular class in a given image. Given an image I 0 , a class c , and a classication ConvNet with the class score function S c ( I ) , we would like to rank the pixels of I 0 based on their inuence on the score S c ( I 0 ) . We start with a motivational example. Consider the linear score model for the class c : S c ( I ) = w T c I + b c ; (2) where the image I is represented in the vectorised (one-dimensional) form, and w c and b c are respec- tively the weight vector and the bias of the model. In this case, it is easy to see that the magnitude of elements of w denes the importance of the corresponding pixels of I for the class c . In the case of deep ConvNets, the class score S c ( I ) is a highly non-linear function of I , so the reasoning of the previous paragraph can not be immediately applied. However, given an image I 0 , we can approximate S c ( I ) with a linear function in the neighbourhood of I 0 by computing the rst-order Taylor expansion: S c ( I )  w T I + b; (3) where w is the derivative of S c with respect to the image I at the point (image) I 0 : w = @S c
