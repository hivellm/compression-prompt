Figure 2: Visualization model. Rightmost column shows nearest example neighboring sample, demonstrate that memorized set. Samples fair random draws, cherry-picked. Unlike visualizations generative models, distributions, conditional Moreover, uncorrelated because sampling process Markov chain mixing. a) MNIST b) TFD CIFAR-10 (fully connected model) CIFAR-10 (convolutional discriminator and deconvolutional generator) 6
