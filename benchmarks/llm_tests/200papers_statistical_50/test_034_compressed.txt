4.2. Natural problems We address task polyphonic prediction, using datasets Piano-midi.de, Nottingham MuseData described Boulanger-Lewandowski (2012) language modelling at level Penn Treebank dataset (Mikolov 2012). also explore version task, where ask predict 5th future (instead next). Our assumption solve this long correlations important than short ones, hence our should helpful. scores reported Table 1 average negative log likelihood time step. xed hyper-parameters across three runs, factor cuto threshold. SGD-CR provides statistically signicant im- provement RNNs all prediction MuseData get exactly same per- formance (Bengio 2012), uses architecture. Table 2 contains (in bits letter). These suggest gradients solves optimization issue does act regular- izer, general. Results Penn Treebank reach state art achieved by Mikolov (2012), who used algorithm similar ours, thus pro- viding evidence behave similarly. reg- ularized performs well Hessian-Free trained model. By employing proposed able improve even
