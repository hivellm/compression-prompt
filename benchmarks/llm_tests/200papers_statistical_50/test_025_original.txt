Figure 4. This diagram illustrates how the change in x t ,  x t , can be large for a small  x 0 . The blue vs red (left vs right) trajectories are generated by the same maps F 1 ; F 2 ; : : : for two dierent initial states. For the specic parametrization provided by equa- tion (11) we can take the analogy one step further by decomposing the maps F t into a xed map ~ F and a time-varying one U t . F ( x ) = W rec  ( x ) + b corresponds to an input-less recurrent network, while U t ( x ) = x + W in u t describes the eect of the input. This is depicted in in Fig. 5. Since U t changes with time, it can not be analyzed using standard dynami- cal systems tools, but ~ F can. This means that when a boundary between basins of attractions is crossed for ~ F , the state will move towards a dierent attractor, which for large t could lead (unless the input maps U t are opposing this) to a large discrepancy in x t . There- fore studying the asymptotic behaviour of ~ F can pro- vide useful information about where such events are likely to happen.
