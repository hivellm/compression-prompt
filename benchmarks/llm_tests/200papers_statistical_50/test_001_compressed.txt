Bayesian Active Classication Preference Neil Houlsby, Ferenc Huszar, Zoubin Ghahramani, Mate Lengyel Computational Biological Laboratory University Cambridge November 27, 2024 Abstract Information been widely studied prob- abilistic models. For simple regression myopic policy easily tractable. However, other tasks complex such as nonparametric solution harder compute. Current make achieve tractabil- ity. propose that expresses gain terms predictive entropies, apply method Classier (GPC). minimal full objective. performance compares favourably many popular algorithms, equal lower complexity. compare well also, privy require much time. Secondly, developing further reformulation binary problem, we extend our algorithm learning. Introduction machine systems, passively collects inferences about its environment. learning, however, seeks measurements trained upon. goal produce best model least possible data; closely related statistical eld design. advent internet expansion storage facilities, quantities unlabelled have become available, but can costly obtain labels.
