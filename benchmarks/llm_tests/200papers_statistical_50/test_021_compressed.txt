@ (see equation (5)) that take form Jacobian matrices. In same way real numbers shrink zero innity, so does (along some direction v ). what follows will try formalize intu- itions (extending similar done Bengio et al. (1994) only single hidden unit case was considered). If consider linear version model (i.e. set identity function (11)) use power iteration method formally analyze prod- uct Jacobian obtain tight conditions when sup- plementary materials detailed conditions). It largest eigenvalue recurrent weight matrix smaller long term components (as ! necessary larger explode. We generalize results nonlinear functions absolute values bounded (say by value 2 R therefore diag 0 )) . We rst prove that it sucient <
