Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neu- ral machine translation often belong to a family of encoderdecoders and encode a source sentence into a xed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a xed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoderdecoder architec- ture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition. 1 I NTRODUCTION Neural machine translation is a newly emerging approach to machine translation, recently proposed by Kalchbrenner and Blunsom (2013), Sutskever et al. (2014) and Cho et al. (2014b). Unlike the traditional phrase-based translation system (see, e.g., Koehn et al. , 2003) which consists of many small sub-components that are tuned separately, neural machine translation attempts to build and train a single, large neural network that reads a sentence and outputs a correct translation. Most of the proposed neural machine translation models belong to a family of encoder decoders (Sutskever et al. , 2014; Cho et al. , 2014a), with an encoder and a decoder for each lan- guage, or involve a language-specic encoder applied to each sentence whose outputs are then com- pared (Hermann and Blunsom, 2014). An encoder neural network reads and encodes a source sen- tence into a xed-length vector. A decoder then outputs a translation from the encoded vector. The whole encoderdecoder system, which consists of the encoder and the decoder for a language pair, is jointly trained to maximize the probability of a correct translation given a source sentence. A potential issue with this encoderdecoder approach is that a neural network needs to be able to compress all the necessary information of a source sentence into a xed-length vector. This may make it difcult for the neural network to cope with long sentences, especially those that are longer than the sentences in the training corpus. Cho et al. (2014b) showed that indeed the performance of a basic encoderdecoder deteriorates rapidly as the length of an input sentence increases. In order to address this issue, we introduce an extension to the encoderdecoder model which learns to align and translate jointly. Each time the proposed model generates a word in a translation, it (soft-)searches for a set of positions in a source sentence where the most relevant information is concentrated. The model then predicts a target word based on the context vectors associated with these source positions and all the previous generated target words.
