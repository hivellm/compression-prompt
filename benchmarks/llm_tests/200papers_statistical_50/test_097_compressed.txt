6.2 N EURAL N ETWORKS FOR M ACHINE T RANSLATION Since Bengio (2003) introduced probabilistic language which uses net- work conditional probability word given xed number preceding words, networks have widely been used translation. However, role net- works has been largely limited simply providing single feature statistical system re-rank list candidate translations provided system. For instance, Schwenk (2012) using feedforward network compute score pair phrases use score additional feature phrase-based statistical system. More recently, Kalchbrenner Blunsom (2013) Devlin (2014) reported successful networks sub-component Traditionally, trained target-side language rescore rerank list candidate translations (see, e.g., Schwenk , 2006). Although above approaches shown improve over state- of-the-art systems, interested ambitious objective designing completely new based networks. trans- lation consider paper therefore radical departure these earlier works. Rather than using part system, our works its own generates directly. 7 C ONCLUSION conventional translation, called approach, en- codes input into vector which will decoded. We conjectured context vector problematic translating long sen- tences, based recent empirical study reported Cho (2014b) Pouget-Abadie (2014). In paper, novel architecture addresses issue. We extended basic letting (soft-)search set input their annotations com- puted encoder, when generating each word. This frees having encode into vector, also lets focus only information relevant generation next word. This major positive impact ability yield good results longer sentences. Unlike traditional systems, all pieces system, including alignment mechanism, jointly trained towards log-probability producing correct translations. We tested model, called RNNsearch, task English-to-French experiment revealed RNNsearch outperforms conventional (RNNencdec) signicantly, regardless length it much ro- bust length sentence. From qualitative analysis where investigated (soft-)alignment generated RNNsearch, able conclude can cor- rectly align each word with relevant words, their annotations, it generated correct Perhaps importantly, approach achieved performance comparable phrase-based statistical It striking result, considering architecture, whole family translation, only recently year. We believe architecture here promising step toward understanding natural languages general. One challenges left future better handle unknown, rare words. This will be required be widely used match performance current state-of-the-art systems all contexts. 9
