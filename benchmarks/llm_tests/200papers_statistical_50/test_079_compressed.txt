In practice, represent limited family distributions via function ( z ; ) , optimize rather than itself. Using perceptron dene introduces multiple critical points space. However, excellent performance per- ceptrons practice suggests that they reasonable model despite their lack guarantees. Experiments trained range datasets including MNIST[23], Toronto Face Database (TFD) [28], CIFAR-10 [21]. mixture rectier linear activations [19, 9] sigmoid activations, while net maxout [10] activations.

We estimate probability test set data tting Gaussian Parzen window samples generated with reporting log-likelihood this distribution.
