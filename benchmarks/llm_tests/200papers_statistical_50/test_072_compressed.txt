2 everywhere. case where G D dened by multilayer perceptrons, entire system trained with backpropagation. There no need for any Markov chains unrolled approximate inference net- works during either training generation Experiments demonstrate potential framework through qualitative quantitative evaluation generated Introduction promise discover rich, hierarchical [2] represent probability distributions over kinds encountered articial intelligence applications, such images, audio waveforms containing speech, symbols language corpora. So far, most involved models, usually those map high-dimensional, sensory class label [14, 22]. These primarily been based backpropagation dropout algorithms, using [19, 9, 10] which particularly well-behaved gradient Deep had less impact, approximating many intractable probabilistic computations arise maximum likelihood related strategies, leveraging context. We propose procedure sidesteps difculties. proposed adversarial framework, against adversary: determine whether distribution distribution. thought team counterfeiters, produce fake currency use it without detection, while police, detect counterfeit currency. Competition this game drives both teams improve their methods until counterfeits indistiguishable genuine articles.
