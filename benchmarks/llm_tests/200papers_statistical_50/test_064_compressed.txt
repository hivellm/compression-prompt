We presented variant online Q-learning combines stochastic minibatch up- dates experience replay memory ease training networks RL. Our approach gave state-of-the-art six seven tested on, no adjustment architecture hyperparameters. References [1] Leemon Baird. Residual algorithms: Reinforcement approximation.
