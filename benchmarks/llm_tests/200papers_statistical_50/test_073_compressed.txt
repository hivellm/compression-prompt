This yield specic algorithms many kinds optimization algorithm. In article, we explore special case when generates passing random through perceptron, discriminative also perceptron. We refer special case case, we using only highly successful backpropagation dropout [17] sample using only forward propagation. No inference or chains necessary. 2 Related An alternative graphical graphical variables, restricted Boltzmann (RBMs) [27, 16], deep Boltzmann (DBMs) [26] their numerous variants. The interactions within represented product unnormalized potential functions, normalized global summa- tion/integration all states random variables. This quantity (the partition function its gradient intractable all most trivial instances, although they estimated chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Mixing poses signicant problem rely MCMC [3, 5]. Deep belief networks (DBNs) [16] hybrid containing single layer sev- eral layers. While fast layer-wise criterion exists, DBNs incur computational difculties associated models. Alternative criteria bound log-likelihood been proposed, score matching [18] noise-contrastive estimation (NCE) [13]. Both these learned density analytically specied up normalization constant. Note many interesting several layers (such DBNs DBMs), it even possible derive tractable unnormalized density. Some denoising auto-encoders [30] contractive autoencoders rules very similar matching applied RBMs. NCE, work, criterion employed t model. However, tting separate model, itself used discriminate generated xed distribution. Because NCE uses xed distribution, slows dramatically after has learned even an approximately correct small subset observed variables. Finally, some techniques involve dening explicitly, draw desired distribution. This approach advantage designed trained back-propagation. Prominent area includes stochastic network (GSN) [5], which extends generalized denoising auto-encoders [4]: seen dening parameterized chain, i.e., one learns parameters performs step chain. Compared GSNs, does chain sampling. Because feedback loops during generation, they better able leverage piecewise linear units [19, 9, 10], which improve performance problems unbounded activation used ina feedback loop.
