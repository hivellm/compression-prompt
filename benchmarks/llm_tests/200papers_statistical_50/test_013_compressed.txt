This algorithm, however, requires much computational time has access full inputs, which have. MES QBC appear close BALD, line falls outside both inter-quartile ranges. As expected, MES discards knowledge observation noise. When there observation noise equivalent 3(c). real-world MES 4(b, e), indicating these mostly noise-free. IVM 3(c), pathologically 3(a); due fact biases selection towards class cluster, reducing posterior entropy rapidly articially. However, also signicantly worse than noise-free (indicated MES’s strong performance) 4(b). This implies IVM’s posterior ADF update detrimental algorithm’s performance. QBC yields small decrement performance, sampling detrimental. However, articial vote criterion maintaining notion inherent uncertainty, like MES. SVM-based exhibits variable (it 4(d), 4(f)). greatly eected used, for consistency present here yielded most consistent performance. Decision theoretic approaches sometimes perform well, 3(c) choose 16 centre each cluster inuenced surrounding unlabelled points.
