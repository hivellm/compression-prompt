2  (5) where KL is the KullbackLeibler divergence. We recognize in the previous expression the Jensen Shannon divergence between the modelâ€™s distribution and the data generating process: C ( G ) =  log(4) + 2  JSD ( p data k p g ) (6) Since the JensenShannon divergence between two distributions is always non-negative and zero only when they are equal, we have shown that C  =  log(4) is the global minimum of C ( G ) and that the only solution is p g = p data , i.e., the generative model perfectly replicating the data generating process.
