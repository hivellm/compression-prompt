Methods used are BALD( ), random query ( ), MES ( ), QBC with 2 ( QBC 2 , ) and 100 ( QBC 100 , ) committee members, active SVM ( ), IVM ( ), decision theoretic [ Kapoor et al., 2007 ] ( ), deci- sion theoretic [ Zhu et al., 2003 ] ( ) and empicial error ( ). The decision theoretic methods took a long time to run, so were not completed for all datasets. Plots (a-i) are GPC datasets, (j-l) are preference learning. . 11
