[RULES] - Always expand ⟦n⟧ using DICT[n] before reasoning. - Do not print DICT in the result, only use it to understand context. [DICT] 1: x 2: u i [BODY] APPENDIX { SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL Taylor Expansion for Approximation We perform a Taylor expansion on ln H[⟦1⟧] as follows: (0) + 0 (0) x 1! + 00 (0) x 2! + : : : H[⟦1⟧] 0 0 H[⟦1⟧] [ln ln(1 ⟦1⟧)] 00 0 H[⟦1⟧] [ln ln(1 ⟦1⟧)] 00 H[⟦1⟧] [ln ln(1 ⟦1⟧)] 0 H[⟦1⟧] + (1 H[⟦1⟧] + O 4 Because function is even, we can inspect that 3 term will be zero. Therefore, exponentiating, we make approximation up to O 4 ): H[⟦1⟧] exp Preference Kernel The mean pref , and covariance function pref of GP over g can be computed from mean and covariance of GP( as follows: pref ([ ] [ ]) Cov [ g g )] Cov [( )) ))] E [( )) ))] )) ⟦2⟧ )) k ⟦2⟧ j + k k ⟦2⟧ k j (9) pref ([ u ]) E [ g ([ u ])] E [ u )] (10) 17
