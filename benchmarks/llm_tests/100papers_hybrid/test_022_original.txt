(otherwise the long term com- ponents would vanish instead of exploding). For tanh we have  = 1 while for sigmoid we have  = 1 = 4 . 2.2. Drawing similarities with Dynamical Systems We can improve our understanding of the exploding gradients and vanishing gradients problems by employ- ing a dynamical systems perspective, as it was done before in Doya (1993); Bengio et al. (1993). We recommend reading Strogatz (1994) for a formal and detailed treatment of dynamical systems theory. For any parameter assignment  , depending on the ini- tial state x 0 , the state x t of an autonomous dynamical system converges, under the repeated application of the map F , to one of several possible dierent attrac- tor states (e.g. point attractors, though other type of attractors exist). The model could also nd itself in a chaotic regime, case in which some of the following observations may not hold, but that is not treated in depth here. Attractors describe the asymptotic be- haviour of the model. The state space is divided into basins of attraction, one for each attractor. If the model is started in one basin of attraction, the model will converge to the corresponding attractor as t grows. Dynamical systems theory tells us that as  changes slowly, the asymptotic behaviour changes smoothly almost everywhere except for certain crucial points where drastic changes occur (the new asymptotic be- haviour ceases to be topologically equivalent to the old one). These points are called bifurcation boundaries and are caused by attractors that appear, disappear or change shape. (Doya, 1993) hypothesizes that such bifurcation cross- ings could cause the gradients to explode. We would like to extend this observation into a sucient condi- tion for gradients to explode, and for that reason we will re-use the one-hidden unit model (and plot) from (Doya, 1993) (see Fig. 3). The x-axis covers the parameter b and the y-axis the asymptotic state x 1 . The bold line follows the move- ment of the nal point attractor, x 1 , as b changes. At b 1 we have a bifurcation boundary where a new attrac- tor emerges (when b decreases from 1 ), while at b 2 we have another that results in the disappearance of one of the two attractors. In the interval ( b 1 ; b 2 ) we are in a rich regime, where there are two attractors and the change in position of boundary between them, as we change b , is traced out by a dashed line. The vector eld (gray dashed arrows) describe the evolution of the state x if the network is initialized in that region.
