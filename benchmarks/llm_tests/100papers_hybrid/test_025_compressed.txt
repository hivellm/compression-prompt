Figure 4. This diagram illustrates how change small 0 The blue vs red (left vs right) trajectories generated same 1 ; 2 two initial states. For specic parametrization provided equa- tion (11) we take analogy step further decomposing into xed map and time-varying W rec b corresponds an input-less recurrent network, while W u describes eect input. depicted Fig. 5. Since changes with time, it not analyzed using standard dynami- cal systems tools, but can. means that when boundary between basins attractions crossed state will move towards attractor, which could lead (unless input opposing this) discrepancy There- fore studying asymptotic behaviour pro- vide useful information about where such events likely happen.
