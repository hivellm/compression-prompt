Crossing boundaries basins attraction local event, sucient ex- plode. If assume into an emerging attractor from disappearing (due bifur- cation) qualies boundary attractors, formulate sucient condition encapsulates obser- vations made Doya (1993), extending them also normal attractions. Note gure, are two b bifurcation, but whole range be crossing. Another limitation previous they autonomous systems observations hold input-driven models. (Ben- gio et al. 1994) dealt assuming bounded noise. The downside approach limits reason about input. practice, supposed drive dynamical system, being able leave model attrac- tor state, kick out basin when certain triggering patterns present themselves. We propose extend our driven models folding map. We family maps apply dierent at each step. Intuitively, explode require same behaviour before, where (at least direction) maps F 1 ; ::; F agree change direction. Fig. 4 describes this behaviour.
