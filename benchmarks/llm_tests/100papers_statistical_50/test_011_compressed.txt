Methods used BALD( random query MES QBC with 2 QBC 2 , 100 QBC 100 , committee members, active SVM IVM decision theoretic [ Kapoor et al., 2007 ] deci- sion theoretic [ Zhu et al., 2003 ] ) empicial error ). The decision theoretic methods took a long time to run, so were not completed for all datasets. Plots (a-i) are GPC datasets, (j-l) are preference learning. . 11
