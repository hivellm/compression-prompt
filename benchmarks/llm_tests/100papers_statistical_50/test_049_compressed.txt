4.1 Task Description To measure quality vectors, dene comprehensive test set contains ve types semantic questions, nine types syntactic questions. Two examples from category shown Table 1. Overall, there 8869 semantic 10675 The category were created steps: rst, similar pairs was created manually. Then, formed connecting pairs. For example, made 68 American cities states they belong to, 2.5K picking at random. included our single token multi-word entities present (such New York ). evaluate overall all question types, type separately (se- mantic, syntactic). Question assumed correctly answered if closest computed above method exactly same correct question; synonyms counted mistakes. This also means reaching 100% likely impossible, current do any input information morphology. However, believe usefulness certain applications should positively correlated metric. Further progress achieved incorporating information structure especially 4.2 Maximization Accuracy used Google News vectors. This contains 6B tokens. restricted vocabulary 1 million frequent Clearly, facing time constrained optimization problem, expected higher dimensional will improve accuracy. estimate best model architecture obtaining good possible quickly, rst evaluated trained subsets frequent 30k results CBOW architecture different choice dimensionality increasing amount shown Table 2. It seen after some point, adding dimensions or adding provides diminishing improvements. So, increase both dimensionality amount together. While this observation might seem trivial, must noted currently popular train vectors on relatively amounts data, but insufcient size 6
