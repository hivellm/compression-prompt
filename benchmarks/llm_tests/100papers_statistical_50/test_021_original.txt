@ x k (see equation (5)) that take the form of a product of t  k Jacobian matrices. In the same way a product of t  k real numbers can shrink to zero or explode to innity, so does this product of matrices (along some direction v ). In what follows we will try to formalize these intu- itions (extending a similar derivation done in Bengio et al. (1994) where only a single hidden unit case was considered). If we consider a linear version of the model (i.e. set  to the identity function in equation (11)) we can use the power iteration method to formally analyze this prod- uct of Jacobian matrices and obtain tight conditions for when the gradients explode or vanish (see the sup- plementary materials for a detailed derivation of these conditions). It is sucient for the largest eigenvalue  1 of the recurrent weight matrix to be smaller than 1 for long term components to vanish (as t ! 1 ) and necessary for it to be larger than 1 for gradients to explode. We can generalize these results for nonlinear functions  where the absolute values of  0 ( x ) is bounded (say by a value  2 R ) and therefore k diag (  0 ( x k )) k   . We rst prove that it is sucient for  1 < 1
