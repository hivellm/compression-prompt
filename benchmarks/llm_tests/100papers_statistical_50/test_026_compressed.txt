@ go zero (for large), means does not depend on (if change stays same). This translates into at close conver- gence towards attractor (which would reach anywhere in neighbourhood ). 2.3. The geometrical interpretation Let us consider simple one hidden unit (equa- tion (8)) provide an initial state train have specic target value after steps. Note for simplicity assume no input. 1 + (8) Fig. 6 shows error surface E 7) 2 5 sigmoid function. We can more easily analyze behavior this further simplifying linear then being identity function), with b 0. w which follows @x
