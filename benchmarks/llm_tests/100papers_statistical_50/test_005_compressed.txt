two entropy quantities. The rst term in Eqn. (2) , H[ y ] can be handled analytically probit case: H[ y ] h Z N df = h @ @ (3) second term, E p jD [H[ y ]] can be computed approximately as follows: E p jD [H[ y ]] Z h(( )) N df (4) Z ln N df exp @ where q . rst approximation, , reects Gaussian ap- proximation posterior. integral left hand side Eqn. (4) is intractable. By performing Taylor expansion on ln h(( )) (see supplementary material) we see that it approximated up O 4 by squared exponential curve, exp ln 2). We will refer approximation . Now we apply standard convolution formula Gaussians nally get closed form expression both terms Eqn. (2). Fig. depicts striking accuracy simple approximation. max- imum possible error that will incurred when using approximation is if N centred at : 05 with tending zero (see Fig. 1, absolute error ), yielding only 0.27% error integral Eqn. (4) . authors are unaware previous use simple and useful approximation context. In Section 5 we investigate experimentally information lost from approximations and compared golden standard extensive Monte Carlo simulation. To summarise, BALD algorithm Gaussian process classication con- sists two steps. First it applies any standard approximate inference algorithm GPCs (such as EP) obtain posterior predictive mean and each point interest . Then, it selects query that maximises following objective function: h 0 @ 0 @ + A A C exp + C + C (5) 5
