2 (5) where KL KullbackLeibler divergence. We recognize in previous expression Jensen Shannon divergence between modelâ€™s distribution generating process: C ( G ) log(4) + 2 JSD k g (6) Since JensenShannon divergence between two distributions always non-negative zero only when they are equal, we have shown that C log(4) global minimum of C G that only solution g = , i.e., generative model perfectly replicating data generating process.
