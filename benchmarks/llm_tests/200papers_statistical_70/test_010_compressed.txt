Exemplars two classes are shown black squares red circles ). Bottom: Results active learning nine methods: random query BALD( MES QBC vote criterion 100 committee members, active SVM IVM decision theoretic: [ Kapoor 2007 ] [Zhu 2003] empirical error ). an asymptotically unbiased estimate expected information gain. Using extensive Monte Carlo as ‘gold standard’, we can evaluate how much we loose by applying these approximations. We quantify approximation error as: max (arg ^ )) 100% (8) where is objective computed using Monte Carlo, ^ is approximate objective. The cancer UCI dataset was used, results discussion are Fig. 2. Pool based active learning: We test BALDfor GPC preference learning pool-based setting i.e. selecting values from a xed set data-points. Although BALD can generalise selecting continuous , this enables us compare algorithms that cannot. We compare eight other algorithms: random sampling, MES, QBC (with 100 committee members), SVM version space approximation [ Tong Koller, 2001 ], decision theoretic approaches [ Kapoor et al., 2007 , Zhu et al., 2003 ] directly minimizing 10
