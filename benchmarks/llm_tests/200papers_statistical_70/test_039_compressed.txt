@ will dom- inate sum because this term grows exponen- tially fast innity with t , same will happen sum. Experimental setup Note that hyper-parameters where selected based their performance validation set using grid search. pathological synthetic tasks Similar success criteria used tasks be- low (borrowed Martens Sutskever (2011)), namely that model should make no more than 1% error batch 10000 test samples. In cases, discrete symbols depicted by one-hot encoding, case regression prediction for given se- quence considered as success if error less than 0.04. Addition problem input consists numbers, where two random positions (one beginning one middle sequence) are marked. model needs predict sum two ran- dom numbers after entire sequence was seen. For each generated sequence we sample length T 0 from [ T; 11
