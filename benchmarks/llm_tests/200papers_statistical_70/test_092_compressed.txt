(c) (d) Figure 3: Four sample alignments found by RNNsearch-50. The x-axis y-axis each plot correspond words source sentence (English) generated translation (French), respectively. Each pixel shows weight ij annotation j source for i -th target word (see Eq. (6)), grayscale ( 0 : black, 1 : white). (a) an arbitrary sentence. (bd) three randomly selected samples among without any unknown between 10 20 from test set. One motivations behind proposed approach was use a xed-length context vector approach. We conjectured this limitation may make approach underperform long sentences. In Fig. 2, we see perfor- mance RNNencdec dramatically drops as increases. On other hand, both RNNsearch-30 RNNsearch-50 are more robust sentences. RNNsearch- 50, especially, shows no performance deterioration even with sentences 50 or more. This superiority proposed model over basic encoderdecoder is further conrmed by fact that RNNsearch-30 even outperforms RNNencdec-50 (see Table 1). 6
