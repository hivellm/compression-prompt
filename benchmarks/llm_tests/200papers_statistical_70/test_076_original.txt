2 . 4 Theoretical Results The generator G implicitly denes a probability distribution p g as the distribution of the samples G ( z ) obtained when z  p z . Therefore, we would like Algorithm 1 to converge to a good estimator of p data , if given enough capacity and training time. The results of this section are done in a non- parametric setting, e.g. we represent a model with innite capacity by studying convergence in the space of probability density functions. We will show in section 4.1 that this minimax game has a global optimum for p g = p data . We will then show in section 4.2 that Algorithm 1 optimizes Eq 1, thus obtaining the desired result. 3
