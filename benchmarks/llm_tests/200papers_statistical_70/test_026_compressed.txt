@ go zero (for large), it means that does not depend on (if we change by some , stays same). This translates into model at being close conver- gence towards some attractor (which would reach from anywhere in neighbourhood of ). 2.3. The geometrical interpretation Let us consider a simple one hidden unit (equa- tion (8)) where we provide an initial state and train have a specic target value after 50 steps. Note that for simplicity we assume no input. w 1 ) + b (8) Fig. 6 shows error surface E ) : 7) 2 , where : 5 and be sigmoid function. We can more easily analyze behavior of this model by further simplifying it be linear then being identity function), with b 0. 0 w from which it follows that @x
