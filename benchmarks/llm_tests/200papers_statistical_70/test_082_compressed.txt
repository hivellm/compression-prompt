Any differentiable function theoretically permitted Table 2: Challenges generative modeling: summary difculties encountered different approaches deep generative modeling for each major operations involving model. 6 Advantages disadvantages This new framework comes advantages disadvantages relative previous modeling frame- works. The disadvantages primarily there no explicit representation p g ( x ) , D must synchronized well G during training (in particular, G must not trained too much without updating D , order avoid Helvetica scenario which G collapses too many values z same value have enough diversity model p data ), much as negative Boltzmann machine must kept up date between learning steps. advantages Markov never needed, only backprop used obtain gradients, no needed during learning, wide variety functions incorporated into model. Table 2 summarizes comparison adversarial nets other modeling approaches. aforementioned advantages primarily computational. Adversarial models may also gain some statistical advantage from generator network not being updated directly data exam- ples, but only gradients owing through discriminator. This means components input copied directly into generatorâ€™s parameters. Another advantage adversarial net- works they represent very sharp, even degenerate distributions, while methods based on Markov require distribution somewhat blurry order able mix between modes. 7 Conclusions future work This framework admits many straightforward extensions: 1. A conditional model p ( j c ) obtained adding c as input both G D . 2. Learned approximate inference performed training an auxiliary network predict z given . This similar inference net trained wake-sleep algorithm [15] but advantage inference net may trained for xed generator net after generator net has nished training. 7
