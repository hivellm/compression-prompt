dominated by long term contributions. 5. Summary Conclusions We provided dierent perspectives through which one can gain more insight into exploding vanishing issue. To deal exploding problem, propose solution involves clipping norm of exploded when it too large. The algorithm motivated assumption when explode, curvature higher or- der derivatives explode well, are faced specic pattern error surface, namely val- ley single steep wall. In order deal vanishing gradient problem use regulariza- tion forces error signal not to vanish as it travels back in time. This regularization term forces Jacobian matrices @ x i
