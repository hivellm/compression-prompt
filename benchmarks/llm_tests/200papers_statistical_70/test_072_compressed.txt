2 everywhere. In case where G D are dened by multilayer perceptrons, entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference net- works during either training generation samples. Experiments demonstrate potential framework through qualitative quantitative evaluation generated samples. 1 Introduction The promise deep learning discover rich, hierarchical models [2] represent probability distributions over kinds data encountered articial intelligence applications, such as natural images, audio waveforms containing speech, symbols natural language corpora. So far, most striking successes deep learning involved models, usually those map high-dimensional, rich sensory input class label [14, 22]. These striking successes primarily been based on backpropagation dropout algorithms, using piecewise linear units [19, 9, 10] which particularly well-behaved gradient . Deep models had less an impact, due difculty approximating many intractable probabilistic computations arise maximum likelihood estimation related strategies, due difculty leveraging benets piecewise linear units context. We propose new estimation procedure sidesteps these difculties. 1 In proposed adversarial nets framework, pitted against adversary: learns determine whether sample distribution data distribution. The can be thought as analogous team counterfeiters, trying produce fake currency use it without detection, while discriminative analogous police, trying detect counterfeit currency. Competition this game drives both teams improve their methods until counterfeits are indistiguishable from genuine articles.
