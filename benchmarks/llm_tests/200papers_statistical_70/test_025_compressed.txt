Figure 4. This diagram illustrates how change , , can be large small 0 . The blue vs red (left vs right) trajectories are generated by same maps 1 ; 2 ; : two dierent initial states. For specic parametrization provided equa- tion (11) we take analogy one step further decomposing maps into xed map and time-varying one U . ( = W rec ) + b corresponds an input-less recurrent network, while U = + W u describes eect input. This is depicted Fig. 5. Since U changes with time, it not be analyzed using standard dynami- cal systems tools, but can. This means that when boundary between basins attractions is crossed , state will move towards dierent attractor, which large could lead (unless input maps U are opposing this) large discrepancy . There- fore studying asymptotic behaviour of ~ F can pro- vide useful information about where such events are likely to happen.
