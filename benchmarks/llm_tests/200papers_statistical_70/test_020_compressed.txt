@ x k (equation (5)) transport error \in time\ from step t back step k . We would further loosely distin- guish between short contributions, where components which everything else. 2. Exploding Vanishing Gradients As introduced Bengio et al. (1994), exploding gradients problem large increase norm gradient during training. Such events are caused by explosion components, which can grow exponentially more then ones. The vanishing gradients problem opposite behaviour, when components go exponentially fast norm 0, making it impossible model learn correlation between temporally dis- tant events. 2.1. The mechanics To understand this phenomenon we need look at form of each temporal component, particular at matrix factors @ x t
