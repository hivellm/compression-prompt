4.2. Natural problems We address task polyphonic music prediction, using datasets Piano-midi.de, Nottingham MuseData described Boulanger-Lewandowski et al. (2012) language modelling at character level Penn Treebank dataset (Mikolov , 2012). We also explore modied version task, where we ask model predict 5th character future (instead next). Our assumption is solve this modied task long correlations more important than short ones, hence our should be more helpful. The training scores reported Table 1 average negative log likelihood per time step. We xed hyper-parameters across three runs, except factor cuto threshold. SGD-CR provides statistically signicant im- provement state-of-the-art RNNs all polyphonic music prediction tasks except MuseData which get exactly same per- formance state-of-the-art (Bengio , 2012), which uses dierent architecture. Table 2 contains results language modelling (in bits per letter). These results suggest gradients solves an optimization issue does not act regular- izer, both training error improve general. Results Penn Treebank reach state art achieved by Mikolov (2012), who used dierent clipping algorithm similar ours, thus pro- viding evidence both behave similarly. The reg- ularized model performs well Hessian-Free trained model. By employing proposed regularization term we able improve test error even tasks that not
