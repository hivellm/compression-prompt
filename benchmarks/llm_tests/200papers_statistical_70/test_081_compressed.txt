c) d) Figure 2: Visualization model. Rightmost column shows nearest example neighboring sample, in order to demonstrate that has memorized set. Samples fair random draws, cherry-picked. Unlike most other visualizations deep generative models, images show actual distributions, conditional means given hidden units. Moreover, uncorrelated because sampling process does depend on Markov chain mixing. a) MNIST b) TFD CIFAR-10 (fully connected model) d) CIFAR-10 (convolutional discriminator and deconvolutional generator) 6
