Appendix C, we provide few more sample translations long source sentences generated by RNNencdec-50, RNNsearch-50 Google Translate along reference translations. 6 R ELATED W ORK 6.1 L EARNING TO A LIGN A similar approach aligning output symbol input symbol proposed recently Graves (2013) context handwriting synthesis. Handwriting synthesis task where model asked generate handwriting given sequence characters. his work, he used mixture Gaussian kernels compute weights annotations, where location, width mixture coefcient each kernel predicted alignment model. More specically, his alignment restricted predict location such that location increases monotonically. The main difference our approach that, (Graves, 2013), modes weights annotations only move one direction. context machine translation, this severe limi- tation, as (long-distance) reordering often needed generate grammatically correct (for instance, English-to-German). Our approach, on other hand, requires computing annotation weight every word source sentence for each word translation. This drawback not severe task translation which most input output sentences are only 1540 words. However, this may limit applicability proposed scheme other tasks. 8
