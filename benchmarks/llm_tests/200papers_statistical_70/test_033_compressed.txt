Figure 7. Rate solving temporal order problem versus log sequence length. See text. lem does not become an issue, addressing explod- ing gradients problem ensures better rate. When combining clipping well regularization term proposed section 3.3, call this algorithm SGD-CR. SGD-CR solved task rate 100% sequences up 200 steps (the maximal Martens Sutskever (2011)). Fur- thermore, train single deal any sequence 50 200 (by providing se- quences dierent dierent SGD steps). Interestingly enough, trained gen- eralize new that twice long ones seen during training . 4.1.2. Other pathological tasks SGD-CR was also able solve (100% on lengths listed below, all but one task) other patho- logical problems proposed Hochreiter Schmid- huber (1997), namely addition problem, mul- tiplication problem, 3-bit temporal order prob- lem , random permutation noise- less memorization two variants (when pattern needed be memorized is 5 bits when it contains over 20 bits information; see Martens Sutskever (2011)). For rst 4 prob- lems single lengths 200, while noiseless memorization dif- ferent each sequence (50, 100, 150 200). The hardest problems which only one trail out 8 succeeded was random permutation problem. In all cases, observe successful generaliza- tion sequences longer than training sequences. In most cases, these results outperforms Martens Sutskever (2011) terms rate, they deal longer sequences than Hochreiter Schmid- huber (1997) compared (Jaeger, 2012) they gen- eralize longer sequences.
