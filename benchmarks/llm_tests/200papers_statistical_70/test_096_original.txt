In conjunction with the quantitative results presented already, these qualitative observations con- rm our hypotheses that the RNNsearch architecture enables far more reliable translation of long sentences than the standard RNNencdec model. In Appendix C, we provide a few more sample translations of long source sentences generated by the RNNencdec-50, RNNsearch-50 and Google Translate along with the reference translations. 6 R ELATED W ORK 6.1 L EARNING TO A LIGN A similar approach of aligning an output symbol with an input symbol was proposed recently by Graves (2013) in the context of handwriting synthesis. Handwriting synthesis is a task where the model is asked to generate handwriting of a given sequence of characters. In his work, he used a mixture of Gaussian kernels to compute the weights of the annotations, where the location, width and mixture coefcient of each kernel was predicted from an alignment model. More specically, his alignment was restricted to predict the location such that the location increases monotonically. The main difference from our approach is that, in (Graves, 2013), the modes of the weights of the annotations only move in one direction. In the context of machine translation, this is a severe limi- tation, as (long-distance) reordering is often needed to generate a grammatically correct translation (for instance, English-to-German). Our approach, on the other hand, requires computing the annotation weight of every word in the source sentence for each word in the translation. This drawback is not severe with the task of translation in which most of input and output sentences are only 1540 words. However, this may limit the applicability of the proposed scheme to other tasks. 8
