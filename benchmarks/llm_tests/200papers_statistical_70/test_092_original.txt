(c) (d) Figure 3: Four sample alignments found by RNNsearch-50. The x-axis and y-axis of each plot correspond to the words in the source sentence (English) and the generated translation (French), respectively. Each pixel shows the weight  ij of the annotation of the j -th source word for the i -th target word (see Eq. (6)), in grayscale ( 0 : black, 1 : white). (a) an arbitrary sentence. (bd) three randomly selected samples among the sentences without any unknown words and of length between 10 and 20 words from the test set. One of the motivations behind the proposed approach was the use of a xed-length context vector in the basic encoderdecoder approach. We conjectured that this limitation may make the basic encoderdecoder approach to underperform with long sentences. In Fig. 2, we see that the perfor- mance of RNNencdec dramatically drops as the length of the sentences increases. On the other hand, both RNNsearch-30 and RNNsearch-50 are more robust to the length of the sentences. RNNsearch- 50, especially, shows no performance deterioration even with sentences of length 50 or more. This superiority of the proposed model over the basic encoderdecoder is further conrmed by the fact that the RNNsearch-30 even outperforms RNNencdec-50 (see Table 1). 6
