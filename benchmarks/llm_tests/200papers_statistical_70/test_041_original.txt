10 ]. The task is to predict the order in which the non-distractor symbols were provided, i.e. either f AA; AB; BA; BB g . We use a 50 hidden units model, with a learning rate of .001 and  , the regularization coecient, set to 2. The cut-o threshold for clipping the norm of the gradient is left to 6. As for the other two task we have a 100% success rate at training a single model to deal with sequences between 50 to 200 steps. This outperforms the previous state of the art because of the success rate, but also the single model generalizes to longer sequences (up to 400 steps). 3-bit temporal order problem Similar to the previous one, except that we have 3 random positions, rst sampled from [ T
