We consider two visualisation techniques, based on computing gradient class score with respect input image. The rst one generates an image, which maximises score 5 ], thus visualising notion class, captured ConvNet. The second technique computes saliency map, specic given and class. We show that such maps can be employed for weakly supervised object segmentation using classication ConvNets. Finally, establish connection between gradient-based ConvNet methods deconvolutional networks 13 ]. 1 Introduction With Convolutional Networks (ConvNets) 10 now being architecture choice large-scale recognition 4 , 8 ], problem understanding aspects visual appearance, captured inside model, has become particularly relevant is subject this paper. In previous work, Erhan et al. 5 visualised models nding an input which max- imises neuron activity interest carrying out an optimisation gradient ascent space. The method was used visualise hidden feature layers unsupervised ar- chitectures, such as Deep Belief Network (DBN) 7 ], it was later employed Le et al. 9 visualise models, captured unsupervised auto-encoder. Recently, problem ConvNet was addressed Zeiler et al. 13 ]. For convolutional layer visualisation, they proposed Deconvolutional Network (DeconvNet) architecture, which aims approximately reconstruct input each layer from its output. In this paper, address ConvNets, trained on large-scale ImageNet challenge dataset 2 ]. To this end, make following three contributions. First, demonstrate that understandable visualisations ConvNet models can ob- tained numerical optimisation input 5 (Sect. 2 ). Note, our case, unlike 5 ], net trained supervised manner, so know which neuron nal fully-connected clas- sication layer should maximised visualise interest (in unsupervised case, 9 had use separate annotated set nd out neuron responsible particular class). To best our knowledge, are rst apply method 5 ImageNet ConvNets 8 ]. Second, propose method computing spatial support given given (image-specic saliency map) using single back-propagation pass through classication ConvNet (Sect. 3 ). As discussed Sect. 3.2 , such saliency maps can be used for weakly supervised object localisation. Finally, show Sect. 4 that gradient-based methods generalise deconvolutional network reconstruction procedure 13 ]. ConvNet implementation details. Our visualisation experiments were carried out using single deep ConvNet, trained on ILSVRC-2013 dataset 2 ], which includes 1.2M training images, labelled into 1000 classes. Our ConvNet is similar that 8 ] and is implemented using their 1
