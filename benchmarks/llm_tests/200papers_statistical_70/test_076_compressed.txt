2 . 4 Theoretical Results The generator G implicitly denes probability distribution g as distribution samples G ( ) obtained when Therefore, would like Algorithm converge good estimator data , if given enough capacity and training time. results this are done non- parametric setting, e.g. represent model with innite capacity by studying convergence space probability density functions. We will show 4.1 minimax game has global optimum for g = data We will then show 4.2 that Algorithm 1 optimizes Eq 1, thus obtaining desired result. 3
