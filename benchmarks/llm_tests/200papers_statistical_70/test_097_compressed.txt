6.2 N EURAL N ETWORKS FOR M ACHINE T RANSLATION Since Bengio et al. (2003) introduced probabilistic language model which uses net- work model conditional probability word given xed number preceding words, networks have widely been used in machine translation. However, role net- works has been largely limited simply providing single feature an existing statistical system or re-rank list candidate translations provided by an existing system. For instance, Schwenk (2012) proposed using feedforward network compute score pair source target phrases use score as an additional feature in phrase-based statistical system. More recently, Kalchbrenner Blunsom (2013) Devlin et al. (2014) reported successful use networks sub-component existing system. Traditionally, network trained target-side language has been used rescore rerank list candidate translations (see, e.g., Schwenk et al. , 2006). Although above approaches were shown improve performance over state- of-the-art systems, we are more interested more ambitious objective designing completely new system based networks. The trans- lation approach we consider this paper therefore radical departure from these earlier works. Rather than using network part existing system, our works its own generates from source sentence directly. 7 C ONCLUSION The conventional approach translation, called an encoderdecoder approach, en- codes whole input sentence into xed-length vector from which will be decoded. We conjectured that use xed-length context vector problematic for translating long sen- tences, based recent empirical study reported by Cho et al. (2014b) Pouget-Abadie et al. (2014). In this paper, we proposed novel architecture that addresses this issue. We extended basic encoderdecoder by letting (soft-)search for set input words, their annotations com- puted by an encoder, when generating each target word. This frees from having encode whole source sentence into xed-length vector, also lets focus only information relevant generation next target word. This has major positive impact ability system yield good results longer sentences. Unlike with traditional systems, all pieces system, including alignment mechanism, are jointly trained towards better log-probability producing correct translations. We tested proposed model, called RNNsearch, task English-to-French translation. The experiment revealed that RNNsearch outperforms conventional encoderdecoder (RNNencdec) signicantly, regardless sentence length that it much more ro- bust length source sentence. From qualitative analysis where we investigated (soft-)alignment generated by RNNsearch, we were able conclude that can cor- rectly align each target word with relevant words, or their annotations, in source sentence as it generated correct translation. Perhaps more importantly, proposed approach achieved performance comparable existing phrase-based statistical translation. It is striking result, considering that proposed architecture, or whole family translation, has only been proposed recently this year. We believe architecture proposed here is promising step toward better better understanding natural languages in general. One challenges left for future is better handle unknown, or rare words. This will be required for model be more widely used match performance current state-of-the-art machine systems in all contexts. 9
