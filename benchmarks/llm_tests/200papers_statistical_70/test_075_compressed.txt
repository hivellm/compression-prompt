(a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 1: Generative adversarial nets are trained by simultaneously updating d iscriminative distribution ( D , blue, dashed line) so that it discriminates between samples data generating (black, dotted line) those enerative (G) (green, solid line). The lower horizontal line domain which z sampled, this case uniformly. The horizontal line above part domain . upward arrows show how mapping = G z ) imposes non-uniform on transformed samples. G contracts regions high density and expands regions low density . (a) Consider an adversarial pair near convergence: similar data and D a partially accurate classier. (b) In inner loop algorithm D trained to discriminate samples data, converging to D ( x ) = data ( )
