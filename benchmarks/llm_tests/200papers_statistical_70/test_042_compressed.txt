domly picked from [3 ; 100]. The task do next symbol prediction, though only predictable sym- bol last one. We use 100 hidden units learning .001 , regularization coecient, set 1. The cuto threshold left 6. This task turns out be more dicult learn, only out 8 experiments succeeded. As before single deal multiple values T (from 50 200 units). Noiseless memorization problem For noiseless memorization are presented binary 5, followed by T steps constant value. After these T steps needs generate seen initially. We also con- sider extension this problem from Martens Sutskever (2011), where 10, symbol set cardinality 5 instead 2. We manage 100% success on these tasks, though train dierent 5 sequence lengths considered (50, 100, 150, 200). Natural Tasks Polyphonic music prediction We train our model, sigmoid RNN, se- quences 200 steps. cut-o coecient thresh- old same in all cases, namely 8 (note that one take mean over sequence when computing gradients). In case Piano-midi.de dataset use 300 hid- den units an initial learning 1.0 (whir learning halved every time error over an epoch increased instead decreasing). For regularized model used initial value for regularization coef- cient 0.5, where follows 1 =t schedule, i.e. t = 1
