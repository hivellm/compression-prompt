For our experiments use EP. that yield pathological behaviour (we investigate this experimentally). These approaches computationally expensive, requiring O N N y updates. Also, they must know locations test (and thus transductive approaches); designing an inductive, decision-theoretic algorithm an open, hard problem it would require expensive integration over possible test data distributions. Non-probabilistic Some non-probabilistic have close analogues information theoretic active learning. Perhaps most ubiquitous active learning SVMs Tong Koller, 2001 , Seung et al., 1992 ], where volume Version Space (VS) proxy entropy. If uniform (improper) prior deterministic classication likelihood, log volume VS Bayesian entropy fact equivalent. Just Bayesian posteriors become intractable after observing many points, VS become complicated. Tong Koller, 2001 ] proposes approximat- ing VS simple shapes, such hyperspheres (their simplest approximation reduces margin sampling). This closely resembles approximating Bayesian using Gaussian distribution via Laplace or EP approximations. Seung et al., 1992 ] sidesteps problem working predictions. al- gorithm, Query Committee (QBC), samples parameters from VS (committee members), they on outcome each possible . most balanced selected; this termed ‘principle maximal disagreement’. If BALD used sampled posterior, query committee implemented but probabilistic measure disagreement. QBC’s deterministic vote criterion discards condence predictions so exhibit same pathologies MES. 5 Experiments Quantifying Approximation Losses: To obtain (5) made two approx- imations: we perform approximate inference 1 ), we approximated binary entropy Gaussian CDF squared exponential 2 ).
