2057 26 Table 1: Parzen window-based log-likelihood estimates. The reported numbers MNIST mean log- likelihood samples test set, with standard error mean computed across examples. On TFD, computed standard error across folds dataset, a different chosen using validation set fold. On TFD, cross validated fold log-likelihood fold were computed. For MNIST compare against other real-valued (rather than binary) version dataset. Gaussians obtained by cross validation validation set. This procedure intro- duced Breuleux et al. [8] used for various generative for which exact is tractable [25, 3, 5]. Results reported Table 1. This method estimating has somewhat high variance does perform well high dimensional spaces but it is best method available to our knowledge. Advances generative can sample but estimate directly motivate further research into how to evaluate such models. In Figures 2 3 show drawn from generator net after training. While make no claim that these better than generated by existing methods, believe that these at least competitive with better generative models literature highlight potential adversarial framework.
