P exp S . The reason is that maximisation class posterior can be achieved by minimising scores other classes. Therefore, we optimise S to ensure that optimisation concentrates only on class in question . We also experimented with optimising posterior P , but results were not visually prominent, thus conrming our intuition. 3 Image-Specic Class Saliency Visualisation In this section we describe how classication ConvNet can be queried about spatial support particular in given image. Given an image 0 , , and classication ConvNet score function S ( ) , we would like to rank pixels 0 based on their inuence on score S ( 0 ) . We start motivational example. Consider linear score model for : S ( ) = w T + b ; (2) where image represented in vectorised (one-dimensional) form, and w and b are respec- tively weight vector and bias model. In this case, it easy to see that magnitude elements denes importance corresponding pixels for . In case deep ConvNets, score S ( ) highly non-linear function , so reasoning previous paragraph can not be immediately applied. However, given an image 0 , we can approximate S ( ) with linear function in neighbourhood 0 by computing rst-order Taylor expansion: S ( I ) w T + b; (3) where w is derivative S with respect to image at point (image) 0 : w = @S
