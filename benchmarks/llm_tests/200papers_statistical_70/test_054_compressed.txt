7 Follow-Up Work After initial version this paper was written, we published single-machine multi-threaded C++ code computing word vectors, using both continuous bag-of-words skip-gram archi- tectures 4 . The training speed is signicantly higher reported earlier this paper, i.e. it is order billions words per hour typical hyperparameter choices. We also more 1.4 million vectors that represent named entities, trained more 100 billion words. Some our follow-up work will be an upcoming NIPS 2013 paper [21]. References [1] Bengio, Ducharme, P.
