This framework can yield specic training algorithms for many kinds model optimization algorithm. In this article, we explore special case when model generates samples passing random noise through multilayer perceptron, discriminative also multilayer perceptron. We refer this special case adversarial nets . In this case, we can train both using only highly successful backpropagation dropout algorithms [17] sample using only forward propagation. No approximate inference or Markov chains necessary. 2 Related work An alternative directed graphical latent variables undirected graphical latent variables, such restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) [27, 16], deep Boltzmann machines (DBMs) [26] their numerous variants. The interactions within such represented product unnormalized potential functions, normalized global summa- tion/integration over all states random variables. This quantity (the partition function its gradient intractable all most trivial instances, although they estimated Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Mixing poses signicant problem learning algorithms rely MCMC [3, 5]. Deep belief networks (DBNs) [16] hybrid containing single undirected layer sev- eral directed layers. While fast approximate layer-wise criterion exists, DBNs incur computational difculties associated undirected directed models. Alternative criteria do approximate or bound log-likelihood have also been proposed, score matching [18] noise-contrastive estimation (NCE) [13]. Both these require learned density analytically specied up normalization constant. Note many interesting several layers latent variables (such DBNs DBMs), it even possible derive tractable unnormalized density. Some denoising auto-encoders [30] contractive autoencoders have learning rules very similar score matching applied RBMs. In NCE, work, discriminative criterion employed t model. However, rather than tting separate discriminative model, itself used discriminate generated samples xed distribution. Because NCE uses xed distribution, learning slows dramatically after has learned even an approximately correct distribution over small subset observed variables. Finally, some techniques do involve dening distribution explicitly, rather machine draw samples desired distribution. This approach has advantage machines designed trained back-propagation. Prominent recent work area includes stochastic network (GSN) framework [5], which extends generalized denoising auto-encoders [4]: seen dening parameterized Markov chain, i.e., one learns parameters machine performs one step Markov chain. Compared GSNs, adversarial framework does require Markov chain sampling. Because adversarial do require feedback loops during generation, they better able leverage piecewise linear units [19, 9, 10], which improve performance backpropagation have problems unbounded activation when used ina feedback loop. More recent examples machine back-propagating into it include recent work auto-encoding variational Bayes [20] stochastic backpropagation [24]. 3 Adversarial The adversarial modeling framework most straightforward apply when both multilayer perceptrons. To learn generatorâ€™s distribution p g over data x , we dene prior on input noise variables p z z , then represent mapping data space G z ; g , where G differentiable function represented multilayer perceptron parameters g . We also dene second multilayer perceptron D ( x ; d ) outputs single scalar. D ( x ) represents probability x came data rather than p g . We train D maximize probability assigning correct label both training examples samples G . We simultaneously train G minimize log(1 D G z ))) : 2
