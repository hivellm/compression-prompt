# Dense Prompt Compression for Vision Models

This is a test document demonstrating the compression of text into fixed-size images
for vision model consumption. The approach is inspired by DeepSeek-OCR's optical context
compression technique, which allows for efficient token usage when working with
vision-language models.

## Background

Large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) process information
differently. While LLMs work with discrete tokens, VLMs can process visual information
encoded as images. By rendering compressed text into monospace images, we can leverage
the visual encoding capabilities of VLMs to potentially achieve better compression ratios.

## Methodology

Our approach uses statistical filtering to compress the text content, removing less
important tokens while preserving semantic meaning. The compressed text is then rendered
into a 1024x1024 PNG image using a monospace font for maximum text density.

Key features include:
- Automatic font size adjustment to fit text
- Consistent line spacing for readability
- Alpha blending for smooth font rendering
- PNG encoding for lossless compression
- Support for both text and image output formats

## Applications

This technology enables several interesting use cases:
1. Efficient context compression for long documents
2. Reduced token costs when using vision models
3. Novel approaches to information density in prompts
4. Integration with multimodal AI systems

## Technical Details

The implementation uses Rust for performance and safety, with the following components:
- Statistical filter for content compression
- Image renderer using ab_glyph and imageproc
- Pluggable output format system
- Comprehensive test suite

The system achieves compression ratios of 30-70% while maintaining semantic quality
through intelligent token importance scoring.
