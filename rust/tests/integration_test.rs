                Deep learning, a subset of machine learning that uses multiple layers of neural networks, \
                has achieved remarkable success in tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, \
                and game playing. Reinforcement learning is another important area of machine learning where \
                agents learn to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The applications of machine \
                learning are vast and include fields such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment. \
